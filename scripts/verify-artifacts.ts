/**
 * Packs every package, installs the tarballs the way a consumer does, and
 * imports every subpath each one declares.
 *
 * This exists because `bun run build` exiting 0 proves almost nothing here.
 * The specs import each sibling's source, so nothing they run loads `dist/`.
 * In nxgt-core, where this script comes from, three defects shipped past a
 * green build, each throwing the instant its package was imported, and all
 * three invisible to `bun run build`, `bun typecheck` and `biome`.
 * Only importing the built artifact catches that class of failure. A bin is
 * the same story, so each one declared is run from `node_modules/.bin` with
 * `--help`: that proves the link, the `#!` line and the mode together.
 *
 * The install uses `overrides` so the packages resolve to each other's
 * tarballs rather than to whatever is on the registry — otherwise this would
 * silently verify the *published* versions instead of the working tree.
 * Everything else resolves from the registry the way a consumer's install
 * does. Optional peers are installed too, the way a
 * consumer who uses the subpath that needs one would.

 * What a published manifest may not contain, measured on Bun 1.4.0 rather than

 *
 *   - a `link:` or `file:` in a field a consumer installs. `devDependencies`
 *     are exempt: a consumer never installs a dependency's dev dependencies,
 *     so a `link:` there is untidy, not harmful.
 *   - a **required** peer that is on no registry. This is the shape that once
 *     broke every consumer's install of nxgt-core with a 404. An *optional*
 *     peer is safe whatever its range; a required one is not.
 *   - a **sibling range that leaves out the sibling in this workspace**, which
 *     is what a stale `bun.lock` publishes.
 *   - an **exact pin on a sibling package**. `workspace:*` publishes as the
 *     exact version, so a package would demand the exact
 *     sibling it was built with while the consumer's own caret range
 *     resolved to a newer one: two copies in one tree, and two
 *     `ValidationError` classes. `workspace:^` publishes
 *     as a caret range, which dedupes.
 *   - a **package that lists itself** in a field a consumer installs. None of
 *     the checks above see it: `@nxgt/material` shipped `"@nxgt/material": "."`
 *     for four months, and `.` is neither a `file:` prefix nor a digit. It is
 *     not inert — `.` resolves to the *consumer's* directory, so every install
 *     grew a second copy of the package reporting the consumer's own version,
 *     plus a `bun.lock` entry no manifest declared and `bun install` kept
 *     re-creating. A package self-references through its `name` and `exports`.
 *   - a **license other than MIT, or no `LICENSE` in the tarball**. npm only
 *     ships the `LICENSE` in the package's own directory, never the root's.
